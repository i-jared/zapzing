# ZapZing App Update Rules

## VERY Important Notes

#1 DO NOT make changes to the UI without approval from the team!!!!
- All current functionality must be preserved during optimization
- Before making changes that will alter functionality, ask for approval from the team
- Database schema can be modified, even if it means deleting existing data, if it improves performance
- Available Firebase services: Firestore, Auth, Functions, Cloud Messaging
- It is ok to change how a feature is written if it will improve performance
- We use DaisyUI for styling, so if you are changing a component, make sure it looks good with DaisyUI
- always reference /docs/ui-updates.md for styling updates
